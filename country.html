                    <p>
                       <span class="big">V</span>enezuela is bordered by the Caribbean <br>Sea and the Atlantic Ocean to the north,<br>
                         Guyana to the east, Brazil to the south,<br> Colombia to the west, and Aruba, the <br>
                         Netherlands Antilles (both the Dutch <br>autonomous territories) to the outside of <br>
                         Venezuela. Island states such as <br>Trinidad and Tobago.

                  <h3> Some thing you dont know</h3>
                    <p>Venezuela’s country name <span class="big">“Venezuela”</span> is<br> actually derived from the Italian word <br>
                      “Little Venice”. Its allusion was discovered by the <br>Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci when he <br>
                      saw the American Indo at Lake Maracaibo. The waters <br>of the high-rise houses in which the Anren<br> lived are named after the waters of Europe.</p>
